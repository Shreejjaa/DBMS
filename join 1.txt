Now let's execute the queries for both scenarios:

Queries for Scenario 1:
a) Find the color of boats reserved by 'Tarun'.

sql
Copy code
SELECT b.color
FROM Boats b
JOIN Reserves r ON b.b_id = r.b_id
JOIN Sailors s ON r.s_id = s.s_id
WHERE s.s_name = 'Tarun';
b) Find the sailor_id's and sailor_names who have reserved boats on 'Monday'.

sql
Copy code
SELECT s.s_id, s.s_name
FROM Sailors s
JOIN Reserves r ON s.s_id = r.s_id
WHERE r.day = 'Monday';
c) List boat id's and boat names for 'red' and 'green' colors only.

sql
Copy code
SELECT b_id, b_name
FROM Boats
WHERE color IN ('red', 'green');
d) Delete all the sailors' information whose age is greater than 60.

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Sailors WHERE age > 60;
Queries for Scenario 2:
a) Get the names of all the teachers of 'Physics' department who teach 'Thermodynamics'.

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.Name
FROM Teacher t
JOIN Taught_By tb ON t.Tid = tb.Tid
JOIN Subject s ON tb.Subno = s.Subno
WHERE t.Dept = 'Physics' AND s.Subtitle = 'Thermodynamics';
b) Rename the subject 'DBMS' to 'RDBMS'.

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Subject SET Subtitle = 'RDBMS' WHERE Subtitle = 'DBMS';
c) Find out all the students who stay in 'Kolkata' and whose roll number is between 20 and 25.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE City = 'Kolkata' AND Rollno BETWEEN 20 AND 25;
d) Display all the students' information in descending order of their roll number who stay in 'Kolkata'.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE City = 'Kolkata' ORDER BY Rollno DESC;
