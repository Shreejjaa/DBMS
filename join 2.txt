Now let's execute the queries:

a) Get PNO & PNAME values of parts that are priced less than 20.

sql
Copy code
SELECT PNO, PNAME
FROM PARTS
WHERE PRICE < 20;
b) Get PNO values for parts for which orders have been placed.

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT PNO
FROM ODETAILS;
c) Get all the details of customers whose names begin with the letter "S".

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE CNAME LIKE 'S%';
d) Get the ONO & CNAME values for customers whose orders have not yet been shipped.

sql
Copy code
SELECT O.ONO, C.CNAME
FROM ORDERS O
JOIN CUSTOMERS C ON O.CNO = C.CNO
WHERE O.SHIPPED IS NULL;
e) Get CNAME & ENAME pairs such that the customer with the same CNAME has placed an order through the employee with the name ENAME.

sql
Copy code
SELECT C.CNAME, E.ENAME
FROM CUSTOMERS C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CNO = O.CNO
JOIN EMPLOYEES E ON O.ENO = E.ENO;
f) Get the name of employees who were hired on the earliest date.

sql
Copy code
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE HDATES = (SELECT MIN(HDATES) FROM EMPLOYEES);
